# Crime Introduction
For my dataset I am looking at all the crime from June 2019. This is the most recent crime data set and I have to do a specific month because of the quanitity of data for all crimes. I picked crimes within my dataset to further prove the arrest data. Sometimes people are arrested in different neighborhoods where they commit a crime or a crime will go unpunished. Coming up for a metric for the data was easy because we are overall trying to show the safest city in Pittsburgh. The metric I decided to use was the number of crimes per neighborhood.
