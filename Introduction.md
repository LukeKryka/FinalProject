# General Introduction
In this project for Big Ideas in computing and information we are determining the safest neighborhood within Pittsburgh. 

# Park Introduction

# Arrest Introduction 
For my dataset I decided to look at the number of arrests throughout the Pittsburgh neighborhoods starting in 2016 and continuing to the present-day. Since this dataset is already pretty recent, I decided to include all of the entries in my analysis. Ultimately since there are still a lot of neighborhoods, I decided to only display the top 20 neighborhoods with the least amount of arrests. 

# Crime Introduction
For my dataset I am looking at all the crime from June 2019. This is the most recent crime data set and I have to do a specific month because of the quanitity of data for all crimes. I picked crimes within my dataset to further prove the arrest data. Sometimes people are arrested in different neighborhoods where they commit a crime or a crime will go unpunished. Coming up for a metric for the data was easy because we are overall trying to show the safest city in Pittsburgh. The metric I decided to use was the number of crimes per neighborhood. 

# Parks Introduction
For my data set I am examining the amount of parks in each neighborhood up to the year of 2021.
Thinking of the general safety of Pittsburgh, we determined that the quantity of parks within the city would likely correlate to the safety of it. We concluded that parks decrease feelings of violence and aggression, in turn, increasing safety of the surrounding area. The metric I decided to use was the number of parks in each neighborhood.
