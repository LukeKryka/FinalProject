In this project for Big Ideas in computing and information we are determining the safest neighborhood within Pittsburgh.

# Arrest Introduction 
For my dataset I decided to look at the number of arrests throughout the Pittsburgh neighborhoods starting in 2016 and continuing to the present-day. Since this dataset is already pretty recent, I decided to include all of the entries in my analysis. Ultimately since there are still a lot of neighborhoods, I decided to only display the top 20 neighborhoods with the least amount of arrests. 

# Crime Introduction
For my dataset I am looking at all the crime from June 2019. This is the most recent crime data set and I have to do a specific month because of the quanitity of data for all crimes. I picked crimes within my dataset to further prove the arrest data. Sometimes people are arrested in different neighborhoods where they commit a crime or a crime will go unpunished. Coming up for a metric for the data was easy because we are overall trying to show the safest city in Pittsburgh. The metric I decided to use was the number of crimes per neighborhood.
