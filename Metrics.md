# Arrest Submetric

# Crime Submetric
My metric was crimes per neighborhood. This means that I am analyzing the crimes being committed in Pittsburgh and the location of these crimes. There were two possible data sets I could use. The police iccidents archive or the 30 days. I decided on the 30 days because it had the most recent arrests and it was enough data not to overflow the spreadsheets.
