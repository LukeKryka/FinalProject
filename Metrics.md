# Arrest Submetric
The metric I chose was the amount of arrests per neighborhoods. The dataset I used was already between the years 2016-2022, so I decided to use all the data and only display the top neighborhoods with the least amount of arrests.

# Crime Submetric
My metric was crimes per neighborhood. This means that I am analyzing the crimes being committed in Pittsburgh and the location of these crimes. There were two possible data sets I could use. The police iccidents archive or the 30 days. I decided on the 30 days because it had the most recent arrests and it was enough data not to overflow the spreadsheets. 

# Park submetric
For the parks metric we measured the amount of parks per neighborhood. This means I am analyzing the amount of parks in a certain neighborhood and their locations. There was only one dataset, so we chose that one.
