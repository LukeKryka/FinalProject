# Crime Conclusion
Once I organized the data to see which neighborhoods committed the least crimes there were clear neighborhoods that were safer then other. The neighborhood with the least amount of crime was Mt. Oliver Boro which only had 93 crimes sense 2016. The next neighborhood with the least crime is Mt. Oliver Neighborhood with only 117 crimes sense 2016. The next three neighborhoods with the least amount of crime are Outside County, Troy Hill-Herrs Island, and Ridgemont. Sense with the park data showing no correlation between crime and arrest we just look at the arrest data to compare. Once looking at the arrest data we will see that Mt. Oliver Neighborhood has the least amount of arrests at only two. The Mt. Oliver Boro suprisingly had 18 arrests. From this data I think that the Mt. Oliver neighborhood is the safest neighborhood because it is second in the least amount of crime sicne 2016 and the least amount of arrests. 
# Arrest Conclusion
Based on all the data provided, Mt. Oliver Neighborhood seems to be the safest neighborhood in Pittsburgh. The least amount of arrests and crime occurred in this neighborhood meaning it topped two out of three of the submetrics. Since I am not from Pittsburgh, my favorite neighborhood and really the only one I know is Central Oakland. I don't have enough insight to compare the two neighborhoods, but based on the data I believe Mt. Oliver Neighborhood is a great place to live.
